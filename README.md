### Files:
 1. [94_allseq_218kb.fa](94_allseq_218kb.fa) - 218kb of sequence for S288c + the additional 93 strains sequenced. Used to construct the tree in Figure 3 from the paper. Described in more detail on page 10 of the supplement to the paper.
 2. [100G_SGD_SGRP.NS128.VIF1_67.vcf.gz](100G_SGD_SGRP.NS128.VIF1_67.vcf.gz) - VCF file of genotypes at 24,360 biallelic SNPs. File contains genotypes for S288c, the 93 strains sequenced for the paper, the six additional previously sequenced strains that were included as "100 genomes" strains, 21 [SGRP](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038%2Fnature07743) strains, and 23 [SGD](http://www.yeastgenome.org) strains. The SNPs included comprised a reduced set constructed by pruning out other SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium. This procedure is described in more detail on page 24 of the supplement to the paper.
